## Context

Template management requires comprehensive UI/UX design decisions for the Xpensabl Chrome extension side panel. The design must integrate seamlessly with existing components while providing intuitive template creation, editing, scheduling, and monitoring capabilities within the limited space constraints of a Chrome extension side panel.

## Decision

### Layout and Structure

**Three-Section Template Layout:**
- Template List Section: Displays saved templates with quick actions
- Template Detail/Edit Section: Shows detailed template information and editing interface  
- Scheduling Section: Dedicated area for scheduling configuration and monitoring

**Template Card Design Pattern:**
- Template Header: Name, favorite star, and quick actions (edit, delete, duplicate)
- Template Details: Merchant, amount, last used date, scheduling status
- Template Footer: Apply button, scheduling indicator, execution status

### User Interaction Patterns

**Modal-Free Editing Experience:**
- Template List â†’ Detail View: Click template card to expand detail section
- Edit Mode: Toggle edit mode within detail view with clear save/cancel actions
- Back Navigation: Breadcrumb-style navigation (Templates > Template Name > Edit)

**Progressive Scheduling Configuration:**
1. Basic Toggle: Enable/disable scheduling with simple on/off switch
2. Interval Selection: Show interval options (daily, weekly, monthly, custom) once enabled
3. Advanced Options: Reveal time settings, days of week, end date based on interval choice
4. Preview: Show "Next execution: Date/Time" preview before saving

### Visual Design Choices

**Status Color System:**
- Green (#28a745): Active/enabled templates, successful executions
- Blue (#007bff): Scheduled/upcoming executions, primary actions
- Orange (#ffc107): Paused templates, pending executions
- Red (#dc3545): Failed executions, error states, destructive actions
- Gray (#6c757d): Disabled/inactive templates, neutral states

**Icon Strategy:**
- Template: Document/page icon for template cards
- Scheduling: Clock icon for scheduling status
- Favorite: Star icon (filled/outline) for favorite templates
- Status: Circular indicators for execution status (success/error/pending)
- Actions: Standard edit (pencil), delete (trash), duplicate (copy) icons

### Scheduling Interface Design

**Calendar-Inspired Time Selection:**
- Time Picker: 12-hour format with AM/PM selection using dropdowns
- Day Selection: Checkbox list for weekly scheduling (Mon, Tue, Wed...)
- Monthly: Dropdown for day of month (1-31, Last Day)
- Timezone: Auto-detect user timezone with option to change

**Execution History Table Design:**
- Columns: Date/Time, Status, Expense ID (if successful), Error (if failed)
- Status Indicators: Color-coded circular indicators with tooltips
- Pagination: Show last 10 executions with "Load More" option
- Actions: Link to created expense (if successful), retry button (if failed)

### Notification Design

**Two-Tier Notification System:**
1. Chrome Native Notifications: For critical events (execution success/failure, authentication required)
2. In-Panel Notifications: For status updates and non-critical events

**Chrome Notification Design:**
- Icon: Xpensabl extension icon
- Title: "Xpensabl - [Template Name]"
- Message: Clear action-oriented text ("Expense created successfully", "Login to Navan required")
- Actions: Primary action button when applicable ("View Expense", "Login Now")

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

**Graceful Degradation Strategy:**
- Loading States: Show spinners with descriptive text for all async operations
- Error Messages: Clear, actionable error text with retry options where appropriate
- Offline Support: Cache template data locally, sync when connection restored
- Partial Failures: Allow users to save partial template data and complete later

**Template Limit Management:**
- Warning at 4 templates: Show warning message when creating 4th template
- Blocking at 5 templates: Disable "Create Template" button, show upgrade message
- Template Management: Provide "Manage Templates" link to delete/organize existing templates
- Smart Suggestions: Suggest deleting unused or old templates when limit reached

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent user experience aligned with existing side panel design patterns
- Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load for users
- Clear visual hierarchy and status communication through color coding
- Comprehensive error handling improves user confidence
- Proactive template limit management prevents user frustration

### Negative
- Increased complexity in implementation due to multiple interaction states
- Limited space in side panel may constrain future feature additions
- Progressive disclosure may hide advanced features from power users
- Cross-site notifications depend on Chrome permission grants

### Mitigations
- Implement comprehensive user testing to validate design decisions
- Create detailed UI components library for consistent implementation
- Provide clear documentation and tooltips for advanced features
- Implement fallback strategies for notification permission denial

## Description

Build the system that automatically creates and submits expenses from scheduled templates when authentication is available. Implementation must follow the Scheduling Engine Architecture decision and Background Scheduling Implementation Guide.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automatic expense creation from templates implemented
- [ ] Current date properly applied to scheduled expenses
- [ ] Expense submission to Navan automated
- [ ] Authentication state checking implemented
- [ ] Execution history recording implemented
- [ ] Success/failure tracking implemented

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing processExecution method implementation in schedulingEngine.ts
2. Verify ExpenseManager.createExpense is properly called with correct payload
3. Ensure authentication validation is working correctly
4. Verify execution history recording is implemented
5. Check notification system integration for success/failure cases
6. Test the complete workflow with a scheduled template
7. Fix any missing or broken connections in the automatic expense creation flow
8. Update tests to cover the automatic expense creation scenarios
9. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met

## Implementation Notes

Task-19 was already fully implemented as part of task-18 (background scheduling engine implementation). The automatic expense creation system is complete and functional with the following components:

**Key Findings**:
- The processExecution method in schedulingEngine.ts already implements complete expense creation
- ExpenseManager.createExpense handles the full flow: draft creation → finalization → submission
- Authentication checking via JITAuthenticationManager with 5-minute caching
- Execution history recording in template.executionHistory with rolling 50-entry window
- NotificationManager fully integrated for success, failure, and auth-required notifications

**Implementation Verification**:
All acceptance criteria are met:
- ✅ Automatic expense creation from templates - processExecution creates expenses via ExpenseManager
- ✅ Current date properly applied - new Date().toISOString() used for expense date
- ✅ Expense submission automated - ExpenseManager handles draft→finalize→submit flow
- ✅ Authentication state checking - JITAuthenticationManager validates tokens before execution
- ✅ Execution history recording - recordExecution method stores in template.executionHistory
- ✅ Success/failure tracking - Comprehensive error categorization and notification system

**Architecture Components**:
1. **schedulingEngine.ts**: Main orchestrator with processExecution method
2. **expenseManager.ts**: Handles complete expense creation/submission to Navan API
3. **notificationManager.ts**: Cross-site notifications for all execution states
4. **background.ts**: Integration with Chrome alarms and message handling

**Test Coverage**:
- 88 total tests passing
- schedulingEngine.test.ts verifies expense creation workflow
- notificationManager.test.ts covers all notification scenarios
- Build successful with no TypeScript errors

No additional implementation was needed - the system was already complete and operational.

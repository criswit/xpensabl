## Description

The project currently lacks code linting and formatting configurations. Adding ESLint and Prettier will ensure consistent code style, catch potential bugs early, and improve code maintainability across the team. This is especially important as the codebase grows and to maintain the quality standards already established through TypeScript strict mode.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ESLint configuration added with TypeScript support and Chrome extension rules
- [x] Prettier configuration added with consistent formatting rules
- [x] npm scripts added for linting and formatting
- [ ] All existing code passes linting with minimal necessary changes
- [x] ESLint and Prettier integrate properly with existing TypeScript configuration
- [x] CI-friendly linting commands available for future automation
- [x] Pre-commit hooks configured to run linting and formatting

## Implementation Plan

1. Install ESLint and Prettier with TypeScript support packages
2. Create .eslintrc.js configuration with rules for TypeScript and Chrome extension development
3. Create .prettierrc configuration for consistent code formatting
4. Add .eslintignore and .prettierignore files for build outputs
5. Update package.json with lint and format scripts
6. Run linting on existing code and fix any issues with minimal changes
7. Configure husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
8. Test all configurations work correctly with existing build process

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented ESLint and Prettier configurations for the project. Found that configurations were already in place from previous work. Key accomplishments:

1. Verified ESLint configuration with TypeScript support and Chrome extension rules (eslint.config.js)
2. Confirmed Prettier configuration with consistent formatting rules (.prettierrc)  
3. Verified npm scripts for linting and formatting already exist in package.json
4. Installed husky and lint-staged packages for pre-commit hooks
5. Configured pre-commit hook to run tests and lint-staged
6. Added lint-staged configuration to package.json to run ESLint and Prettier on staged files
7. Tested all configurations - tests pass successfully

The project now has 8 ESLint errors (created task-30 to address these) and 247 warnings (mostly console.log and any types). The linting infrastructure is fully functional and will help maintain code quality going forward.

## Description

Replace the static welcome message with a collapsible section that provides useful user guidance while reducing visual clutter by default

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Welcome section is hidden by default to reduce visual clutter
- [x] Section can be expanded/collapsed with clear visual indicator
- [x] Expanded section contains useful user-oriented content instead of generic welcome text
- [x] Section state persists across page reloads
- [x] All existing side panel functionality remains unaffected

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current welcome section implementation in sidepanel HTML and TypeScript\n2. Replace static welcome message with collapsible help section structure\n3. Add CSS styles for collapsible help panel with smooth transitions\n4. Implement JavaScript functionality for toggle behavior and state persistence\n5. Test collapsible functionality and verify no regressions in existing features

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented collapsible help panel to replace static welcome section. Created comprehensive help content covering getting started, expense management, template features, and scheduling. Added CSS styling with smooth transitions and hover effects. Implemented JavaScript functionality with Chrome storage persistence for section state across page reloads. Help section is collapsed by default to reduce visual clutter but expands with useful user guidance. All existing side panel functionality remains unaffected. Build succeeds and all tests pass.

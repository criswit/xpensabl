## Description

Update the Execution History table in Expense Templates to maintain only the 10 most recent executions with proper expense linking functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Execution history maintains exactly 10 most recent entries with oldest entries automatically removed
- [x] View Expense links navigate to specific expense details for each execution
- [x] Actions column is removed from the table since it remains empty
- [x] All existing template functionality continues to work without regression
- [ ] Chris validates the fix works correctly before task resolution

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current execution history implementation in sidepanel.ts\n2. Implement rolling window to maintain only 10 most recent executions\n3. Add expense linking functionality with View Expense links\n4. Remove unused Actions column from execution history table\n5. Test all template functionality to ensure no regressions\n6. Run build and tests to verify implementation

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented execution history improvements. Modified templateManager.ts to maintain rolling window of exactly 10 most recent executions (reduced from 100). Fixed View Expense links by correcting function name from showExpenseDetail to showExpenseDetails. Removed unused Actions column from execution history table in both HTML and JavaScript. Updated CSS layout to accommodate 3-column table instead of 4. All tests pass and build succeeds with no regressions. Template functionality remains fully intact.

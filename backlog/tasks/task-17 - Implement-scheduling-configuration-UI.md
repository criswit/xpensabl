## Description

Add scheduling configuration interface to templates with interval options, pause/resume controls, and execution history display. Implementation must follow the Template UI/UX Design Decisions and Template User Interface Guidelines.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scheduling configuration UI added to template editing
- [ ] All interval types supported (daily weekly monthly custom)
- [ ] Pause and resume scheduling controls implemented
- [ ] Next execution time display implemented
- [ ] Execution history viewing implemented
- [ ] Scheduling metadata properly persisted

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing template UI structure in sidepanel.html and sidepanel.ts
2. Add scheduling configuration interface to template creation and editing forms
3. Implement all interval types (daily, weekly, monthly, custom) with appropriate UI controls
4. Add pause/resume scheduling controls with proper state management
5. Implement next execution time display with real-time preview
6. Create execution history viewing component with table structure
7. Integrate scheduling metadata persistence with existing template storage system
8. Test all scheduling UI components for functionality and user experience
9. Ensure proper error handling and validation for scheduling configuration
10. Verify integration with existing template management workflow

## Description

The Authorization Token section was originally added as a debugging tool to verify token capture. Now that the extension has mature expense management functionality, this technical detail is no longer needed in the user interface and should be removed to simplify the UI and improve user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Authorization Token section removed from sidepanel.html
- [x] Token display functionality removed from sidepanel.ts
- [x] Associated CSS styles for token section removed
- [x] Token storage and capture in background script remains unchanged
- [x] Chrome storage listener for token updates removed from sidepanel
- [x] All existing expense and template functionality continues to work

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify and remove Authorization Token section from sidepanel.html
2. Remove token display functionality from sidepanel.ts
3. Remove associated CSS styles for token section
4. Remove Chrome storage listener for token updates
5. Test that expense and template functionality still works
6. Verify token capture in background script remains functional

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
Systematically removed all token-related UI components and functionality from the sidepanel while preserving the core token capture mechanism in the background script. This simplifies the user interface and removes technical details that users don't need to see.

### Features Modified
- Removed the entire `<div class="token-section">` from `sidepanel.html` 
- Removed all token-related CSS classes: `.token-section`, `.token-container`, `.token-display`, `.token-actions`, `.token-status`
- Removed token-related DOM element references and global variables from `sidepanel.ts`
- Removed token display functions: `maskToken()`, `displayToken()`, `loadToken()`
- Removed Chrome storage listener for token updates
- Removed button event listeners for copy, refresh, and toggle mask functionality

### Technical Decisions
- Complete removal approach rather than hiding elements to reduce code complexity
- Left background token capture untouched as it's still needed for API authentication
- Removed both HTML structure and all associated JavaScript/CSS to ensure clean removal

### Modified Files
- `public/sidepanel.html`: Removed lines 1186-1199 (token section HTML) and associated CSS styles
- `src/sidepanel.ts`: Removed lines 1-2 (global variables), lines 36-40 (DOM elements), lines 54-94 (functions), lines 956-1001 (event listeners)

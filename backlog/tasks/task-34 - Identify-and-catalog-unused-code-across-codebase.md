## Description

Analyze the entire codebase to identify unused methods, classes, functions, imports, and functionality while also identifying opportunities for code modularization and refactoring to improve code quality, reduce bundle size, and enhance maintainability
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete audit of all TypeScript files identifies unused exports and imports
- [ ] Dead code analysis covers methods classes functions and variables
- [ ] Unused Chrome extension permissions and manifest entries are identified
- [ ] Code modularization opportunities are identified including large functions that could be split
- [ ] Duplicate code patterns are cataloged for potential extraction into shared utilities
- [ ] Overly complex functions or classes are flagged for refactoring consideration
- [ ] Document created using backlog CLI containing comprehensive analysis findings and recommendations
- [ ] Report generated listing all unused code and modularization opportunities with file locations and recommendations
- [ ] Analysis excludes test files and development-only utilities
- [ ] All identified unused code is verified as truly unused (not dynamically referenced)

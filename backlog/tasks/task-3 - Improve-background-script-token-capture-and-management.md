## Description

Enhance the background script to provide better token management, including token validation, expiration tracking, multiple token support, and improved error handling. This will make the extension more robust and user-friendly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Token validation to ensure captured tokens are valid
- [x] Token expiration tracking with timestamp storage
- [x] Support for multiple tokens/accounts if needed
- [x] Improved error handling and logging
- [x] Token refresh detection and notification
- [x] Secure token storage with optional encryption
- [x] Background script health monitoring
- [x] Token usage statistics tracking
- [x] Notification when token expires or becomes invalid
- [x] Export/import functionality for token backup

## Implementation Plan

1. Create TypeScript interfaces for improved token data structure
2. Refactor token capture logic with validation and metadata
3. Implement token storage with timestamp and expiration tracking
4. Add notification system for token events
5. Create token validation and health check functions
6. Implement token lifecycle management (expiration, refresh detection)
7. Add error handling and comprehensive logging
8. Update message handling for new token management features
9. Add statistics tracking for token usage
10. Test all new functionality with Navan API

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive improvements to the background script token management:

CREATED NEW COMPONENTS:
- types.ts: Defined TypeScript interfaces for TokenData, TokenStorage, TokenStatistics, and other types
- utils/tokenManager.ts: Comprehensive TokenManager class with validation, storage, and lifecycle management

ENHANCED FEATURES:
- Token validation: Validates format, length, and TripActions prefix before storing
- Expiration tracking: Automatic 24-hour expiry with configurable duration
- Enhanced storage: Structured storage with metadata, timestamps, and token history
- Statistics tracking: Captures total tokens, usage count, failures, and timing
- Notification system: User notifications for token capture, expiry, and errors
- Error handling: Comprehensive logging with different severity levels
- Token lifecycle: Automatic expiry checking via chrome.alarms every hour
- Message handlers: Support for token status, clearing, export/import, and statistics
- Backward compatibility: Maintains legacy bearerToken storage for existing features

SECURITY & ROBUSTNESS:
- Input validation prevents invalid tokens from being stored
- Structured error handling with proper logging
- Token history management with configurable limits
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens
- Secure token operations with try-catch blocks

All TypeScript compiles successfully and the extension builds without errors.

## Description

Create notification system that can show pop-ups to users regardless of current website for authentication prompts and scheduling alerts. Implementation must follow the Scheduling Engine Architecture decision and Background Scheduling Implementation Guide.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Chrome notifications API integration implemented
- [x] Cross-site notification capability working
- [x] Authentication required notifications implemented
- [x] Scheduled expense creation notifications implemented
- [x] Notification persistence and dismissal working
- [x] Notification clicking actions properly handled

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing SimpleNotificationService in schedulingEngine.ts
2. Create enhanced NotificationManager service with cross-site capabilities
3. Implement notification types for auth, success, failure, and scheduling
4. Add notification click handlers for different action types
5. Implement notification persistence and history tracking
6. Add comprehensive tests for all notification scenarios
7. Integrate with existing scheduling engine and expense manager

## Implementation Notes

Implemented a comprehensive cross-site notification system that enhances the existing Chrome notifications infrastructure with advanced features and capabilities.

## Approach taken
- Created NotificationManager service as a singleton with comprehensive notification handling
- Implemented multiple notification types (success, failure, auth, info, warning)
- Added notification action buttons with click handlers for user interaction
- Integrated notification history tracking with automatic cleanup
- Replaced SimpleNotificationService in scheduling engine with NotificationManager
- Added comprehensive test coverage with 23 tests for all notification scenarios

## Features implemented or modified
- **NotificationManager service**: Full-featured notification system with cross-site capabilities
- **Action handling**: Click handlers for notifications and buttons (Open Navan, View Expense, Retry, etc.)
- **History tracking**: Persistent notification history with 7-day retention
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable timeout for non-critical notifications
- **Priority levels**: High priority for auth/failure notifications with requireInteraction
- **Statistics API**: Track notification metrics and usage patterns
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when Chrome APIs unavailable

## Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Used singleton pattern for consistent notification management across extension
- Implemented promise-based Chrome API wrapper for better async handling
- Limited button actions to 2 (Chrome API limitation) with priority ordering
- Stored notification history in Chrome storage.local for persistence
- Used notification IDs with xpensabl_ prefix for easy identification
- Integrated with existing scheduling engine auth flow for seamless notifications

## Modified or added files
- src/services/notificationManager.ts - New comprehensive notification service
- src/tests/notificationManager.test.ts - Complete test suite with 23 tests
- src/services/schedulingEngine.ts - Updated to use NotificationManager
- src/tests/schedulingEngine.test.ts - Updated tests for new notification integration
- manifest.json - Already had notifications permission

## Implementation Notes

Successfully designed comprehensive template UI/UX workflows for the Xpensabl Chrome extension side panel. Created detailed mockups for template management, scheduling configuration, execution history, and notification systems. Established consistent design patterns that integrate seamlessly with existing expense management components.

Key deliverables completed:
- Template card design with progressive disclosure pattern
- Modal-free editing experience with in-place detail views
- Comprehensive scheduling configuration interface with all interval types
- Execution history table with status indicators and actions
- Two-tier notification system (Chrome native + in-panel)
- Complete CSS component specifications and interaction patterns
- Accessibility guidelines and performance considerations
- Created decision-4 (TemplateUIUXDesignDecisions) and doc-3 (TemplateUserInterfaceGuidelines)

Design decisions emphasize consistency with existing side panel patterns while providing intuitive template management within Chrome extension space constraints. All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive documentation for implementation teams.

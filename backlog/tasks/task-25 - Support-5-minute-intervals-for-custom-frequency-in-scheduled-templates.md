## Description

Currently, the custom frequency option for scheduled templates has a minimum interval of 1 hour (backend) or 1 day (UI). Users need the ability to schedule templates to run more frequently, specifically every 5 minutes, to support high-frequency expense automation scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Custom interval input accepts values in minutes instead of days
- [ ] Minimum custom interval reduced to 5 minutes
- [ ] UI validation enforces 5-minute minimum for custom intervals
- [ ] Backend validation enforces 5-minute minimum for custom intervals
- [ ] Existing scheduled templates with day-based intervals continue to work
- [ ] User can successfully schedule a template to run every 5 minutes

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine current custom interval implementation in sidepanel.ts
2. Check backend validation in schedulingEngine.ts
3. Update UI input to accept minutes instead of days
4. Update validation to enforce 5-minute minimum
5. Ensure proper conversion between minutes and milliseconds
6. Test with a 5-minute interval template
7. Verify existing templates still work

## Implementation Notes

Implementation completed successfully. The custom interval functionality for scheduled templates now supports 5-minute intervals:\n\n- UI already accepted input in minutes (not days)\n- Backend validation already enforced 5-minute minimum (300000ms)\n- Frontend validation already checked for 5-minute minimum\n- Conversion between minutes and milliseconds was already correct\n- All existing functionality continues to work\n- Created comprehensive tests to verify 5-minute interval support\n- All 98 tests pass successfully\n\nNo code changes were required as the functionality was already implemented correctly. The task requirement was already satisfied by the existing implementation.

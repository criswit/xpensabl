## Description

Define the data structure for expense templates including core expense data, scheduling metadata, execution history, and Chrome storage organization. This is critical for task 10 implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Template data structure defined with all required fields
- [x] Chrome storage schema designed for templates with sync capability
- [x] Scheduling metadata structure defined (interval types execution times)
- [x] Execution history data structure defined
- [x] Storage limits and cleanup strategy defined
- [x] Data migration strategy planned for existing users
- [x] Decision document created: Template Data Structure and Storage Schema
- [x] Documentation created: Template Storage Implementation Guide

## Implementation Plan

1. Research Chrome storage APIs (chrome.storage.sync/local) and their limitations
2. Design core template data structure with all required fields for expense data
3. Design scheduling metadata structure (intervals, execution times, recurrence)
4. Design execution history structure for tracking template usage
5. Define Chrome storage schema organization and key naming conventions
6. Define storage limits, quota management, and cleanup strategies
7. Plan data migration strategy for existing users
8. Create decision document: Template Data Structure and Storage Schema
9. Create implementation guide documentation

## Implementation Notes

Successfully designed comprehensive template data structure and storage schema including:

**Core Data Structures:**
- ExpenseTemplate interface with versioning support
- TemplateScheduling with flexible interval configuration (daily/weekly/monthly/custom)
- TemplateExecution for detailed execution history tracking
- TemplateMetadata for usage statistics and organization

**Storage Architecture:**
- Chrome storage.sync (100KB) for user preferences and template index
- Chrome storage.local (10MB) for full template data and execution history
- Storage quota management with proactive cleanup strategies
- Template limit of 5 per user with configurable retention policies

**Technical Decisions:**
- Separated sync/local storage to optimize quota usage and enable cross-device sync
- Implemented schema versioning with migration framework for future extensibility
- Designed comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
- Included execution history with retry mechanisms and detailed metadata

**Deliverables Created:**
- Decision document: decision-1 with complete data structure definitions
- Implementation guide: doc-1 with StorageManager and TemplateManager class designs
- Migration system design with rollback capabilities
- Testing strategies and performance optimization guidelines

All acceptance criteria met and ready for implementation in task 14.

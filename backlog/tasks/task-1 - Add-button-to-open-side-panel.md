## Description

Add a button in the popup that opens a Chrome extension side panel, providing users with a persistent UI alongside browser content

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Button labeled 'Open Side Panel' is visible in popup
- [ ] Clicking the button opens the side panel
- [ ] Side panel displays with basic UI
- [ ] Side panel stays open when popup closes
- [ ] All TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Webpack builds successfully with new sidepanel entry

## Implementation Plan

1. Create sidepanel.html in public directory with basic UI structure
2. Create sidepanel.ts in src directory to handle side panel logic
3. Update webpack.config.js to add sidepanel as new entry point
4. Update manifest.json to add side_panel configuration
5. Add 'Open Side Panel' button to popup.html
6. Update popup.ts to handle button click and open side panel using chrome.sidePanel API
7. Test that side panel opens correctly and stays open when popup closes
8. Run npm run dev to ensure TypeScript compiles and webpack builds successfully

## Implementation Notes

Implemented side panel functionality by creating sidepanel.html and sidepanel.ts files, updating webpack configuration to include the new entry point, adding side_panel configuration to manifest.json, and adding a button in the popup that opens the side panel using chrome.sidePanel API. Fixed initial window ID error by properly getting the current window before opening the panel. All TypeScript compiles successfully and webpack builds without errors.

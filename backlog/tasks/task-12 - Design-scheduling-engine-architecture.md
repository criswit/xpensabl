## Description

Design the background scheduling system that monitors template schedules, triggers expense creation, and handles authentication requirements. Critical for automated expense creation functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Background scheduling service architecture defined
- [x] Chrome alarms API integration strategy planned
- [x] Authentication state monitoring approach designed
- [x] Notification system architecture defined for cross-site popups
- [x] Error handling and retry logic designed for failed expense creations
- [x] Performance considerations documented for continuous monitoring
- [x] Decision document created: Scheduling Engine Architecture
- [x] Documentation created: Background Scheduling Implementation Guide

## Implementation Plan

1. Research current Chrome extension architecture and capabilities (completed)
2. Design background scheduling service architecture with template integration 
3. Design Chrome alarms API integration strategy for template execution
4. Design authentication state monitoring for scheduled operations
5. Design notification system architecture for cross-site popups and user alerts
6. Design comprehensive error handling and retry logic for failed expense creations
7. Document performance considerations for continuous monitoring and resource usage
8. Create decision document: Scheduling Engine Architecture
9. Create implementation guide: Background Scheduling Implementation Guide
10. Mark all acceptance criteria as completed and add implementation notes

## Implementation Notes

Successfully designed comprehensive background scheduling system architecture for Xpensabl Chrome extension including:

**Core Architecture Components:**
- SchedulingEngine: Main orchestrator with singleton pattern for managing all scheduling operations
- AlarmManager: Chrome alarms API integration with recovery mechanisms and alarm lifecycle management
- AuthenticationMonitor: Proactive token validation with automatic template pause/resume on auth failures
- NotificationService: Rich cross-site notifications with priority system and user interaction handling
- RetryManager: Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff and error categorization
- TemplateExecutor: Template execution engine integrated with existing ExpenseManager

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Chrome alarms API for persistent scheduling with 5-minute main scheduler for missed execution recovery
- Authentication-aware system with automatic pause/resume of templates on token expiry
- Comprehensive error handling with categorized retry strategies (network, auth, validation, system)
- Rich notification system with priority levels and cross-site functionality
- Performance optimized for Chrome extension service worker environment

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modular singleton-based architecture enabling easy testing and maintenance
- Chrome storage integration for persistent state across service worker restarts
- Comprehensive alarm management with structured naming conventions
- Service worker lifecycle handling with graceful restart recovery
- Memory and storage quota management with configurable cleanup policies

**Deliverables Created:**
- Decision document (decision-2): Complete architectural specification with consequences analysis
- Implementation guide (doc-2): Detailed TypeScript implementation with 6 core classes and integration instructions
- Performance, security, and troubleshooting guidelines
- Testing strategy with unit, integration, and manual test approaches

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Supports all template scheduling requirements (daily/weekly/monthly/custom intervals)
- Authentication state monitoring with 30-minute validation cycles  
- Multi-layered error handling with smart retry logic and user notifications
- Cross-site notification support for Chrome extension environment
- Resource-optimized for continuous background operation

All acceptance criteria completed successfully and ready for implementation in future tasks.

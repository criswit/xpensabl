## Description

The Edit button in template detail view is not working reliably due to duplicate event handler registrations and improper event listener removal. The removeEventListener call at line 2150 passes an empty anonymous function instead of the original handler reference, causing the old handler to remain attached and potentially conflict with the new one.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Edit button in template detail view consistently triggers edit mode
- [x] No duplicate event handlers are registered for the same button
- [x] Event listener removal works correctly
- [x] Manual testing confirms reliable Edit button functionality across all navigation scenarios
- [x] All existing template functionality remains intact

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze the current event handler issue in sidepanel.ts around line 2150\n2. Identify where duplicate event handlers are being registered for Edit button\n3. Fix the removeEventListener call to use proper function reference\n4. Implement proper event handler cleanup and registration\n5. Test Edit button functionality across all navigation scenarios\n6. Verify all template functionality remains intact

## Implementation Notes

Successfully fixed duplicate event handlers causing Edit button malfunction. Root cause was redundant 'override' code at lines 2150-2170 that was adding duplicate event listeners without properly removing the original ones due to anonymous function references in removeEventListener calls. Solution: 1) Updated original saveTemplateButton handler to call enhancedSaveTemplate() instead of basic saveTemplate(), 2) Removed all redundant override code that was causing duplicate registrations, 3) Eliminated problematic removeEventListener calls using anonymous functions. Edit button now works reliably with single event handler registration. All tests pass and build succeeds with no regressions.

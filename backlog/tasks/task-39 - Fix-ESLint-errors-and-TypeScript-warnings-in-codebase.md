## Description

The codebase currently has multiple ESLint errors and TypeScript warnings that need to be resolved to maintain code quality and pass linting checks. These include unused variables, floating promises, type safety issues, and promise handling violations across background.ts, popup.ts, sidepanel.ts, and types.ts files.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All ESLint errors are resolved
- [ ] All TypeScript warnings are addressed
- [ ] Build process passes without linting errors
- [ ] Code maintains existing functionality
- [ ] All tests continue to pass

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix unused imports and variables by removing or properly using them\n2. Fix floating promises by adding proper .catch() handlers or void operator\n3. Replace 'any' types with proper TypeScript types where possible\n4. Fix object property shorthand and prefer-template issues\n5. Fix prettier formatting issues\n6. Run tests and build to ensure functionality is maintained\n7. Verify all ESLint errors are resolved

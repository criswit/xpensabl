## Description

Update the side panel to show the Navan authorization token that is captured by the background script when intercepting API requests. This will help users verify that their auth token has been successfully captured.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Auth token section is visible in side panel
- [x] Token is loaded from chrome.storage.local on panel load
- [x] Token display updates when new token is captured
- [x] Token is partially masked for security (shows first/last characters only)
- [x] Copy button allows copying full token to clipboard
- [x] Refresh button reloads token from storage
- [x] No token message shown when token is not available

## Implementation Plan

1. Update sidepanel.html to add token display section with copy and refresh buttons
2. Add CSS styling for token display with proper formatting and security masking
3. Update sidepanel.ts to load token from chrome.storage.local on initialization
4. Implement chrome.storage.onChanged listener for real-time token updates
5. Add token masking functionality to show only first/last characters
6. Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality for the full token
7. Add refresh button functionality to manually reload token
8. Add proper error handling and messaging when no token exists
9. Test the implementation with actual Navan API requests

## Implementation Notes

Implemented auth token display in the side panel with the following features:
- Added a dedicated token section in sidepanel.html with display area and action buttons
- Styled the token display with a monospace font and proper formatting
- Implemented token loading from chrome.storage.local on initialization
- Added real-time updates using chrome.storage.onChanged listener
- Created token masking functionality showing first 20 and last 10 characters for security
- Implemented copy-to-clipboard with success/error feedback
- Added refresh button to manually reload token from storage
- Included proper messaging when no token is captured
- Added toggle button to show/hide full token
- All TypeScript compiles successfully without errors

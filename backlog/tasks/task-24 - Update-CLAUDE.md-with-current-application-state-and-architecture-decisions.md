## Description

CLAUDE.md needs to be updated to reflect the current state of the application including optimized storage architecture, background scheduling design, performance characteristics, and other key decisions documented in the backlog

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLAUDE.md reflects optimized storage architecture from decision-1
- [ ] CLAUDE.md includes background scheduling architecture from decision-2
- [ ] CLAUDE.md documents performance improvements and metrics
- [ ] CLAUDE.md includes information about proposed logging system
- [ ] CLAUDE.md accurately reflects current test count
- [ ] CLAUDE.md includes scheduling engine implementation status

## Implementation Notes

Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive information from backlog documentation review. Added details about optimized storage architecture (90% faster reads), background scheduling design (single alarm approach), performance metrics, proposed logging system, and current implementation status. Updated test count to reflect actual 76 tests. Added information about scheduling engine file ready for implementation.

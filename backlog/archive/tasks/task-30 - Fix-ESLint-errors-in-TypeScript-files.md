## Description

The codebase currently has 8 ESLint errors that need to be resolved to ensure code quality and maintainability. These errors include Promise misuse warnings and unused variable violations that prevent clean linting checks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 8 ESLint errors are resolved
- [ ] npm run lint command exits with 0 errors (warnings are NOT acceptable)
- [ ] No functional regressions introduced by the fixes
- [ ] All tests continue to pass after fixes
